      "Inglourious Basterds (2009) | Quentin Tarantino | Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender",
    quote: "I think this might just be my masterpiece",
    thoughts: `What worked extremely well for this movie is that it fully embraces itself as an anti-Nazi revisionist revenge fantasy. Specifically through the cathartic comeuppance of Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) of the SchutzStaffel; a "Jew Hunter" who takes pleasure in exerting power over those who have none. Importantly, Tarantino does not force catharsis by exploiting Holocaust tragedy. Instead, he builds tension through setting up the meticuluous, cunning, cruel, seemingly immovable Landa against the violent, Nazi-despising, unstoppable force of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). The movie thus centers itself around the inevitable clash between Landa and Raine, and this I feel is what elevates it beyond generic anti-Nazi revenge porn to a gripping tale of an oppressor who represents Nazi sadism, that gets a gruesome, gratitutous comeuppance at the end.

    Another aspect of this movie that truly elevates it, is attention to detail. How many movies do we watch that invent miracles out of faulty logic to protect their protagonists? In this one though, Michael Fassbender's Lt. Wicox and a couple of the other Basterds die because Wicox blew his cover from not knowing the German way to sign 3 (use thumbs!). Lt. Raine and Pt. Utevich (BJ Novak) get captured because Col. Landa called their absurd bluff of being Italian in origin. Even something as basic as a movie being based in Nazi-Occupied France having 70% of its dialog in German and French signals so much more depth of characterization in a war movie.
    
    Sure, war movies could be great even through just giving voices to the protagonists, and dehumanizing the enemy. But the catharsis of anti-Nazi revenge is that much sweeter when the Nazis have meaningful speaking roles and characters, and we then see every bit of light in their life evaporate. For a closing thought, in the lasting words of Lt. Aldo Raine: 'Bonjyuur-no'`,

    trivia: `Tarantino almost did not go through with this movie due to not finding a German-speaking actor who 
    could also pull off the role of Hans Landa. Fortunately he found one in the form of Christoph Waltz (who could 
    also speak French fluently), who then won an Oscar for the role.`,

    quote: "King Kong ain't got shit on me!",
    thoughts: `I did not know going into this movie that it was about police corruption. However, this worked brilliantly because as the events unfolded, I shared Officer Jake Hoyt's (Ethan Hawke) rising sense of suspicion and horror towards his bent training officer Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Apropos of that, Washington delivered an effortlessly slick performance as usual, easing gracefully into the role of a corrupt detective who commands attention, but is really a yard bully who deserves only to have his gross facade blown wide open. The rookie-veteran chemistry between Hawke and Washington was of the essence to the success of the movie, with both actors playing their characters off each other in a truly enjoyable fashion.

    Bottom-line: a very enjoyable movie and one of the greats to me in terms of performance and tension.`,

    quote: "What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?",
    thoughts: `This movie to me is one of the greats when it comes to portraying desolation and possibly nihilism. 
               Anton Chigurh (Bardem) does so well as a psychopathic serial killer because he believes he's a vassal for an indifferent 
               universe, bringing death to those he thinks are momentary specks in the scheme of fate. All his scenes work to 
               deliver this message in fact; from when he determined whether a gas station attendant lived or died by a coin flip, to 
               taunting Carla Jean for telling him he doesn't "have to" kill her. What's more interesting is that at the end, Anton 
               himself almost dies in a car crash and has to bribe 2 teenage boys for their silence as he runs off on foot. Whether Anton 
               knows he himself is subject to fate, or he wrongly assumed he was a proteced agent of fate is unknown, but it was a 
               brilliant choice by the Coens to send off his character on this note. While we're here, an interesting ambiguity for me 
               was in the scene where Anton kills someone and the victim's assistant ponders on whether he would die too. 
               Anton says, "I don't know. Do you see me?". This could either be taken as saying he would spare the assistant if he doesn't 
               tell anyone anything, or that Anton sees himself as some sort of Grim Reaper and that the assistant seeing him means his death 
               is confirmed.
               More on the uninhibited twisted hand of fate
               though, we have the characters of Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) and Sheriff Bell (Jones). The Coens making us follow Moss
               for over half the movie as he desperately flees from Chigurh and then abruply killing him off screen at the hand of some subplot-related
               Mexican gangsters was a very pronounced choice in feeding into the theme of the movie: that most things in real life aren't 
               wrapped up with a bow. Similarly, Sheriff Bell retiring in the middle of the case because he's afraid that the winds, specifically 
               Chigurh, are too strong for him to tussle with is perhaps closest to the title of the movie itself. I interpret the title as
               meaning no one grows old in such desolate lands as those populated by monsters like Chigurh. Certainly when Bell reminisces 
               on being 20 years older now than his father, also a sheriff, when he died, I feel emboldened in my interpretation. A few have 
               criticized NCFOM as pointless and self-indulgent, but I think it is a movie driven very strongly by its choices in writing and direction
               to deliver a certain message and does so successfully.

    title:
      "Oppenheimer (2023) | Christopher Nolan | Cilian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr.",
    quote: "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.",
    thoughts: `In what I think is a first for me, it was definitive that a lead of a movie (Cillian Murphy) should sweep Best Actor. I'd only read about the absolute destruction that the Manhattan Project wrought on Oppenheimer's soul, and I wouldn't even have held it against Cillian not to be able to fully replicate such a harrowing psychological crisis. Yet, he knocked it out of the park anyway - right from the robotic, defeated voice to the empty eyes that seem to have witnessed eons of misery.

    In general, there are two things I particularly liked about Oppenheimer.
    First, I believe that this is Nolan's best film in terms of the artistic-visual experience. Nolan likes incorporating neat little explanations into his movies (the famous wormhole explanation in Interstellar, or the explanation of reverse time in Tenet) but in Oppenheimer he showed a lot more than he told. The starry, stringy, spacey visuals of the hidden Quantum Universe that eluded Oppenheimer; the firey, snappy chemical reactions inside the envisioned bomb. These brought a life to the story of Oppenheimer, and more importantly the science in his life, in a way I've never seen before. I liked Nolan's decision to include more visuals of the story leading up to the bomb (Trinity, the B-52 that dropped the bombs), rather than making a spectacle of Hiroshima and Nagasaki itself. Oppenheimer didn't get to actually see the final bombing - only anticipate it as well as ruminate in its aftermath, and this is what Nolan brought to us. Nolan's choice to use Black&White for the objective, and color for the subjective, is also a choice I found to be intelligent not only to tell his non-chronological story, but also emphasize further that a bulk of the movie is entirely from the perspective of Oppenheimer.
    
    The second thing I liked, was that the dialogue in Oppenheimer packs a lot of wit into sharply-delivered, almost cutting exchanges between characters. It reminded me of a typical David Fincher and/or Aaron Sorkin film (A Few Good Men, Fight Club). I found myself genuinely immersing myself in the marriage of the crisp dialogue and the actors selling them with their full determination. Apart from the visuals, the smooth dialogue really buttered the explanation of the science underlying the story.
    
    I went into this movie with tempered expectations; expecting something minimally good out of a Nolan movie but hoping not to be disappointed. Fortunately, the movie easily overdelivered - selling me on it in the first 20 minutes. Oppenheimer felt like a time machine sucking me in after the first act and keeping me hooked through the 3 hours till the credits.`,

      "Sicario (2015) | Denis Villeneuve | Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin",
    quote:
      "You're asking me how a watch works. For now, let's just keep an eye on the time.",
    thoughts: `I watched Sicario expecting a slightly better-than-average action flick centered around 
               cartel violence in Mexico - a topic touched on many times. However, I was taken completely by Villeneuve's masterful
               expression of tension, terror and trauma, simply through BGM, POV, and dialogue (or lack thereof). 
               It could be his taking us through the unethicality of the mission at hand through 
               the POV of Kate (Blunt) - who's just a little too naive for her seasoned Black Ops colleagues, and for the 
               violence & depravity in Juarez. Or it could be through cutting most of Benicio Del Toro's dialogue - 
               for his role as "Alejandro", an insidious "consultant" to the Black Ops team - to bolster his mysterious 
               nature and elevate the sense of Unknown that shrouds the mission we're witnessing. From the very first scene of the movie where 
               hundreds of decomposing bodies are found embedded in the walls of a house, to the border crossing scene, 
               to the end where Kate's life hangs in the balance, it is all a fine work in tension & peril. Roger Deakins' 
               cinematography is no-less, for the aerial wide-shots grasping the size of the environments that the teams are working in, truly 
               convey the monumentality of the task ahead of them. Villeneuve and Deakins surely utilized scale to their 
               advantage in painting pictures of places that may as well eat our protagonists alive. Furthermore the final shot of 
               the movie works brilliantly, in conjunction with the dual meanings of "Sicario", to blur the lines between 
               protagonist and antagonist in this movie. Villeneuve tells us at the start that "Sicario" in Ancient Rome referred to a person 
               who rose up against invaders, and it also means "hitman" in Mexico today. This hints as to the narrative
               of the movie without boxing any of its stakeholders into "the invaded", "the invador" or "the hitman" 
               (for all the groups we're shown could've fit these roles equally). The fact that these definitions are 
               presented at the start is actually in my opinion a cheeky foreshadowing to the uncertainty that the movie imbues in
               the audience (or Kate, as the audience stand-in) as to who exactly to root for as events unfold. In closing, just like Kate I was hooked 
               and accelerated into an experience that I found quintessentially tense, and which I was left in awe after
               dismounting.

      "Did you think your song and dance and your superstition would help you?",
    thoughts: `I had expected this movie to be about a cold-blooded, over-ambitious businessman whose rise and fall 
    is precipitated by gross megalomania. I was completely right and yet still surprised by what I got in many ways. 
    Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) merely speaking of his growing hatred of people and his bloodlust
    for winning - a brilliant turning point of a monologue for his character - pales in comparison to him shooting a man in cold-blood whom was trying to do the right thing in the
    wrong way, and mocking his disabled son whose disability he himself was responsible for. I also think PTA made a brilliant 
    choice in weaving religion into his story of blood and oil, for I believe Daniel Plainview was not only a disbeliever
    but some sort of Devil or Demon figure that feigned & mocked the purity (or he would say naivety) of the 
    townfolk he claimed to serve. This dichotomy even rears its head in the title of the movie; referring both to the cleansing
    nature of the Blood of Jesus that is brought up often in the movie, and to the trail of blood left behind by 
    Daniel Plainview in his aholy quest for power. Conflicting ideas of puritanism and self-flagellation were also 
    brilliantly portrayed by Paul Dano who somehow both serves as a foil for Daniel Plainview and also seems cut from the 
    same cloth somehow in some small way. The evidence of this being how the supposedly reverent Eli Sunday (Dano) beats his father 
    for letting Daniel in their space, and comes back to a weak Daniel to bargain in bad-faith for more money 
    and land. In general the brilliance of acting in TWWB does not need to be repeated, 
    but certainly I was sold by the way Day-Lewis and Dano manipulated even the finest mannerisms 
    of their characters to sell the setting of the story (think Daniel Plainview having what seems to be a permanent
    hunch in the movie especially towards the end from the backbreaking oil-drilling he's done, as well as his alcoholism). 
    To end off, TWBB was my first PTA film but I think it was a wonderfully written story; appearing like a simple - 
    even mundane - story about oil at the start, and then justifying its title by the end with an almost poetic beauty.`,

    title:
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) | Martin Scorsese | Lily Gladstone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro",
    quote: "Can you find the wolves in this picture?",
    thoughts: `The decision by Scorsese to shift the focus of the story from the FBI investigation of a series of Osage murders to the marriage between Mollie - an Osage woman trapped in the middle of the depravity - and Ernest (Gladstone, DiCaprio) made this movie for me. Not only did this reframe the focus of the movie from a typical "whodunnit" to the visceral injustice felt by the Osage, but it allowed for the biting portrayal of Ernest - trapped in between his love for Mollie and the grotesque machinations of his uncle William "King" Hale (De Niro).

    Acting wise, Gladstone was phenomenal in eliciting rage and sorrow in the abuse she suffered at the hands of Hale and his cronies. Even having sparse dialogue, her expressions and body language conveyed a rich tapestry of emotions - an example being her silent but scathing disappointment in Ernest when he doesn't admit to the truth of poisoning her insulin. DiCaprio meanwhile transforms himself into the simple-minded, meek-mannered character of Ernest; truly earning praise during the court testimony scene when it breaks him to confess to shamelessly enabling his uncle's borderline evil exploits against his wife.
    
    The cinematography served to remind audiences that this is a historical narration above being merely a movie, with the blending in of B&W (possibly modern recreated) footage of the Osage people, and chilling sequences of shots of murdered Osage akin to casket photos. The use of tint was very deliberate in creating different auras in the film - rich and lively for the culturally delightful Osage celebrations, blueing and grey for Hale's schemes and the court scenes, and orange and red for Mollie's worsening health.
    
    Through acting and cinematography alone I can truly appreciate KOTF as a fine example of cinema. Still, there is the screenplay to praise. It was obvious how much effort Scorsese put into doing justice to the Osage, while still achieving a nuanced portrayal by telling much of the story from the perspective of Ernest. Showing Ernest's realisation that he cannot ignorantly support his uncle while also wanting a family with Mollie was very effective for example, in illustrating how one doesn't dread the poison they are enabling until it comes back to corrupt the water they drink. All in all, KOTF is a very finely narrated, heart-wrenching story that I am glad Scorsese picked up. I've appreciated many movies in the past and while this one isn't necessarily objectively better than them, I truly felt Scorsese's dedication to cinema with this one.`,

      "The Batman (2022) | Matt Reeves | Robert Pattinson, Paul Dano, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright",
    quote: "They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I am the shadows.",
    thoughts: `The Batman is one of the more artistic films I've seen, insofar as several frames of the movie are 
               reminiscent of paintings - each extremely evocative in establishing an environment of eeriness, almost satanic.
               In fact, I'm already hooked at the opening sequence - a standout in my opinion amongst 
               not just movies of this genre but movies in general - which paints the titular character as something 
               primal and fear-inspiring. To clarify, it is not the specific aura ("primary and fear-inspiring") 
               that I am impressed by necessarily but the use of the physical setting combined with background score and 
               lighting to create a gripping abstraction of the Batman without even showing him on screen. 
               Many comparisons have been made between The Batman and Se7en (1995), specifically in-terms of the 
               serial killer plot and the process of discovering his crimes and identity. I think this is fair, but 
               special commendation has to be given to Matt Reeves for contextualising it still to Gotham, the Batman 
               and his infamous Rogues Gallery. For example, over the course of the crimes and uptill neutralising 
               the Riddler, we see the Batman's character development from being only a symbol of fear to 
               a beacon of hope (apropos of this, the shot of Batman leading the stranded to safety with a 
               flare was particularly effective, especially as it subverted the bright glowing red color from 
               being associated with fear and danger to being associated with safety and hope). Indeed, the whole 
               series of crimes in The Batman leading up to the final act were all just a framework for developing 
               a younger Batman's troubled relationship with Gotham. To keep this review concise, I'll comment briefly
               on the comparison of this movie to The Dark Knight (2008). Many people often say TDK is a better movie
               and The Batman is a better Batman movie. I find this an interesting soundbite but it really all comes down
               to what you, as a viewer, appreciate in movies more. I have an affinity for the artistry of a movie - 
               set design, lighting, background score & soundtrack, and cinematography - which is why The Batman takes it
               ever so slightly for me. Of course, if you're one for dialogue, characterization and how effectively a 
               movie tackles larger, more realistic issues - then TDK would be the clear option for you. Ultimately, I 
               think both movies are brilliant and for The Batman specifically, 3 hours was barely enough for me to let
               the technical and creative talent put into this movie soak in.`,

    thoughts: `"I delayed watching this movie for longer than I should've" - was my first thought after watching it. To begin with, I felt that 2001 had some very effective cinematography; particularly the ones interweaving nature (outer space, planets, etc) with the somewhat crude look of invented technologies (space stations, capsules, etc). Despite being made in 1968, I don't feel that 2001's cinematography is really much behind that of Interstellar (for an example of modern space sci-fi). As such this movie is a quintessential example to justify Stanley Kubrick's nature as a visionary.

    What really sealed the greatness of 2001 for me though was the final 30 minutes; a perfect culmination of every seemingly isolated sequence we silently sat through. Throughout the movie we pick up on the meaning of the esoteric monolith and the consequences of interacting with it but to end off the movie showing instead the result of not interacting with it (that being a restoration of innocence and childlike wonder instead of a fury to conquer and to thrust forward recklessly into the vestiges of the unknown) was incredibly conscientious.
    
    My analysis of a movie tends to be mostly for what it is and refrains from the influence of any external context that shaped it (though that is certainly important). In this case however I think it absolutely adds to 2001 that Kubrick reneged on making a space race propaganda film to tell his own tale about the vicious cycle of pursuing innovation for combative and invasive purposes. Brava.

    trivia: `According to Sir Arthur C. Clarke, Stanley Kubrick wanted to get an insurance policy from Lloyds of London to protect himself against losses in the event that extraterrestrial intelligence were discovered before the movie was released. Lloyds refused. Carl Sagan commented, "In the mid-1960s, there was no search being performed for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the chances of accidentally stumbling on extraterrestrial intelligence in a few years' period was extremely small. Lloyds of London missed a good bet."`,

    thoughts: `Truth be told I only watched this movie because Martin Scor-sees seemed to have held it in high esteem. However, that absolutely made sense to me after watching it.

    I interpreted the movie as fundamentally about a man with a penchant for the visual arts (or maybe just a pathological need for respect?) stuck between a rock and a hard place. His first option: an effortlessly successful CBM actor with no sense of personal identity for himself or among his fans, continually oppressed by his character. His second option: an auteur of theatre with respect from high brow audiences (whom are supposedly more educated on the arts than CBM fans) but with no respect from critics due to his "tainted" origins as a movie star, and a level of required effort that literally drains his blood.
    
    While I'm not well-versed enough of the inner contexts of Hollywood to say if the conflict above is an entirely accurate representation for real-life actors, I do think Birdman delivered an intelligent and more-importantly moving commentary through what I felt was a very standout performance from Michael Keaton.
    
    There are a multitude of other things to unpack about Birdman that can't be written about in brief (whether this movie was meant to imitate Michael Keaton's life is just one of the possible discussions). However, it is certainly a very well-written story to me with memorable sound design and cinematography and the extended cameos from Edward Norton and Emma Stone were certainly not unnoticed as well.

    quote: "Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.",
    thoughts: `I generally have a low opinion of movies that use depravity as a cheap vehicle to audience engagement. That's why I, and in fact most people, have a deep distaste of movies like The Human Centipede and A Serbian Film that are just the director's creative exercise in how ****** up of a story they can present. Essentially the director themselves feel more like the antagonist of the story, therefore drawing the ire of audiences.

    However, I think what worked for Oldboy is that despite going down the route of stretching how much it can torture the protagonists, this was still written within and around a well-defined narrative; in this case of revenge and mystery. The weaving in of what would otherwise be empty platitudes like "Ask not why you were imprisoned but why you were set free" and "Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink the same" to actually underline the plot and themes of the story stood out to me as well. At this juncture I'd also like to argue that that Lee Woo-jin will go down in history as one of the worst (and therefore well-written) antagonists in cinema.
    
    Choi Min-silk and Kang Hye-jung's performances were also biting to me, especially when it comes to despair and the crushed hope that precedes it as well as in carrying the demeanour of individuals who are all too aware of pain.
    
    However, I still give this movie a 3.5 because why Oh Dae-su was written to forget that Mido is his daughter instead of forgetting their sexual encounters is beyond me. Additionally, while Choi's performance was praiseworthy, I did feel like he was playing a character at times instead of being absorbed into it (something I think Leonardo DiCaprio does extremely well).
    
    Nonetheless, this movie will linger on my mind for a while and I am happy never rewatching it. Good job Park.
