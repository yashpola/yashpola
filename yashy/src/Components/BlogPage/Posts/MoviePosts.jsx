      "Inglourious Basterds (2009) | Quentin Tarantino | Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender",
    quote: "I think this might just be my masterpiece",
    thoughts: `What worked extremely well for this movie is that it fully embraces itself as an anti-Nazi revisionist
            revenge fantasy. Specifically through the cathartic comeuppance of
            Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) of the SchutzStaffel; a "Jew Hunter" who takes pleasure in exerting power
            over those who have none. Importantly, Tarantino does not force catharsis by exploiting Holocaust tragedy.
            Instead, he builds tension through setting up the meticuluous, cunning, cruel, seemingly immovable Landa against
            the violent, Nazi-despising, unstoppable force of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). The movie thus centers itself
            around the inevitable clash between Landa and Raine, and this I feel is what elevates it beyond generic 
            anti-Nazi revenge porn to a gripping tale of an oppressor who represents Nazi sadism, that gets a gruesome, 
            gratitutous comeuppance at the end. Another aspect of this movie that truly elevates it, is 
            attention to detail. How many movies do we watch that invent miracles
            out of faulty logic to protect their protagonists? In this one though, Michael Fassbender's Lt. Wicox and a couple of
            the other Basterds die because Wicox blew his cover from not knowing the German way to sign 3 (use thumbs!). 
            Lt. Raine and Pt. Utevich (BJ Novak) get captured because Col. Landa called their 
            absurd bluff of being Italian in origin. Even something as basic as a movie being based in Nazi-Occupied France having
            70% of its dialog in German and French signals so much more depth of characterization in a war movie. 
            Sure, war movies can be great even through just giving voices to the protagonists, and dehumanizing
            the enemy. But the catharsis of anti-Nazi revenge is that much sweeter when the Nazis have meaningful speaking
            roles and characters, and we then see every bit of light in their life evaporate. For a closing thought, in the lasting words of Lt. Aldo
            Raine: 'Bonjyuur-no'`,
    rating: `8.7/10. The only significant ding I would give this
    movie is that I found Pt. Zoller's (Daniel Bruhl) character somewhat of a misplaced distraction to the focal point 
    of Landa and Raine's arcs. But I understand that his role was functional to highlight an underrepresented aspect of
    the Nazi regime: their utilization of mass-media, specifically cinema, to rally war efforts and
    fluff up their supposed heroism`,
    trivia: `Tarantino almost did not go through with this movie due to not finding a German-speaking actor who 
    could also pull off the role of Hans Landa. Fortunately he found one in the form of Christoph Waltz (who could 
    also speak French fluently), who then won an Oscar for the role.`,

      "Training Day (2001) | Antoine Fuqua | Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke",
    quote: "King Kong ain't got shit on me!",
    thoughts: `I did not know going into this movie that it was about police corruption. However, this worked brilliantly because 
               as the events unfolded, I truly shared Officer Jake Hoyt's (Ethan Hawke) rising sense of suspicion and horror towards
               his bent training officer Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Apropos of that, Washington delivered an 
               effortlessly slick performance as usual, easing gracefully into the role of a corrupt detective who 
               commands attention, but is really a yard bully who deserves only to have his gross facade blown wide open. 
               The rookie-veteran chemistry between Hawke and Washington was of the essence to the success of the 
               movie, with both actors playing their characters off each other in a truly enjoyable fashion. Vis-a-vis 
               the subject matter of the movie, perhaps my favorite scene is the final one, when Det. Harris 
               fruitlessly tries to rally the support of a community that he had been a part of for decades against 
               Jake Hoyt. Det. Harris had given up on society and believed he deserved to look out for himself 
               first, but in the end his self-serving tendencies became not only
               his downfall, but his demise. In fact, my interpretation is that Harris had thought he was serving the 
               community in some twisted fashion, by being "one of them" and
               fuelling their gangsterism. This makes the ending more poignant, when the community actually sides with Jake. While the plot 
               - supposedly partially based on a true story - and themes themselves are simple, it is rewarding to see
              the innocent virtuosity of Jake Hoyt persist in the face of torture (yes, literally) and betrayal. A
              contrivance often criticized of Training Day is that a girl who Jake saved from being raped in the beginning was conveniently the 
              cousin of a gangster who is enlisted by Harris to kill Jake, thus saving him in the last minute. I don't 
              agree that this is a contrivance. I see this as a subtle butterfly effect instead,  
              important to the overall theme - because it rewards Jake for actually doing his duty and 
              saving the girl, in spite of Alonzo's negative influence.`,
    rating: `I give this movie 7.5/10 because it is a simple story that is carried by very compellingly acted characters. I
    doubt I would have as much fun watching it if not for Denzel and Hawke`,

      "No Country for Old Men (2007) | Coen Brothers | Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones",
    quote: "What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?",
    thoughts: `This movie to me is one of the greats when it comes to portraying desolation and possibly nihilism. 
               Anton Chigurh (Bardem) does so well as a psychopathic serial killer because he believes he's a vassal for an indifferent 
               universe, bringing death to those he thinks are momentary specks in the scheme of fate. All his scenes work to 
               deliver this message in fact; from when he determined whether a gas station attendant lived or died by a coin flip, to 
               taunting Carla Jean for telling him he doesn't "have to" kill her. What's more interesting is that at the end, Anton 
               himself almost dies in a car crash and has to bribe 2 teenage boys for their silence as he runs off on foot. Whether Anton 
               knows he himself is subject to fate, or he wrongly assumed he was a proteced agent of fate is unknown, but it was a 
               brilliant choice by the Coens to send off his character on this note. While we're here, an interesting ambiguity for me 
               was in the scene where Anton kills someone and the victim's assistant ponders on whether he would die too. 
               Anton says, "I don't know. Do you see me?". This could either be taken as saying he would spare the assistant if he doesn't 
               tell anyone anything, or that Anton sees himself as some sort of Grim Reaper and that the assistant seeing him means his death 
               is confirmed.
               More on the uninhibited twisted hand of fate
               though, we have the characters of Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) and Sheriff Bell (Jones). The Coens making us follow Moss
               for over half the movie as he desperately flees from Chigurh and then abruply killing him off screen at the hand of some subplot-related
               Mexican gangsters was a very pronounced choice in feeding into the theme of the movie: that most things in real life aren't 
               wrapped up with a bow. Similarly, Sheriff Bell retiring in the middle of the case because he's afraid that the winds, specifically 
               Chigurh, are too strong for him to tussle with is perhaps closest to the title of the movie itself. I interpret the title as
               meaning no one grows old in such desolate lands as those populated by monsters like Chigurh. Certainly when Bell reminisces 
               on being 20 years older now than his father, also a sheriff, when he died, I feel emboldened in my interpretation. A few have 
               criticized NCFOM as pointless and self-indulgent, but I think it is a movie driven very strongly by its choices in writing and direction
               to deliver a certain message and does so successfully.

    title:
      "Oppenheimer (2023) | Christopher Nolan | Cilian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr.",
    quote: "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.",
    thoughts: `In what I think is a first for me, it was definitive that a lead of a movie (Cilian Murphy) should sweep Best Actor. 
               I'd only read about the absolute destruction that the Manhattan Project wrought on Oppenheimer's soul, and I wouldn't 
               even have held it against Cilian not to be able to fully replicate such a harrowing psychological crisis. Yet, he knocked
               it out of the park anyway - right from the robotic, defeated voice to the empty eyes that seem to have witnessed 
               eons of misery. In general, there are two things I particularly liked about Oppenheimer that I think should earn Nolan Best 
               Director if not Best Picture. 
              
               First, I believe that this is Nolan's best film in terms of the artistic-visual experience. 
               Nolan likes incorporating neat little explanations into his movies (the famous wormhole explanation in Interstellar, 
               or the explanation of reverse time in Tenet) but in Oppenheimer he showed a lot more than he told. 
               The starry, stringy, spacey visuals of the hidden Quantum Universe that eluded Oppenheimer; the firey, 
               snappy chemical reactions inside the envisioned bomb. These brought a life to the story of Oppenheimer, and more 
               importantly the science in his life, in a way I've never seen before. I liked Nolan's decision to include more 
               visuals of the story leading up to the bomb (Trinity, the B-52 that dropped the bombs), rather than making a 
               spectacle of Hiroshima and Nagasaki itself. Oppenheimer didn't get to actually see the final bombing - only 
               anticipate it as well as ruminate in its aftermath, and this is what Nolan brought to us. Nolan's choice to use 
               Black&White for the objective, and color for the subjective, is also a choice I found to be intelligent not only 
               to tell his non-chronological story, but also emphasize further that a bulk of the movie is entirely from the perspective 
               of Oppenheimer. 
              
               The second thing I liked, was that the dialogue in Oppenheimer packs a lot of wit into sharply-delivered, almost cutting exchanges
               between characters. It reminded me of a typical David Fincher and/or Aaron Sorkin film (A Few Good Men, Fight Club). 
               I found myself genuinely immersing myself in the marriage of the crisp dialogue and 
               the actors selling them with their full determination. Apart from the visuals, the smooth dialogue really
               buttered the explanation of the science underlying the story. 

               I went into this movie with tempered expectations; expecting something minimally good out of a Nolan movie but 
               hoping not to be disappointed. Fortunately, the movie easily overdelivered - selling me on it in the first 20 minutes. 
               Oppenheimer felt like a time machine sucking me in after the first act and keeping me hooked through the 3 hours till 
               the credits.`,
    rating: `9/10. The amount of expository dialogue combined with the length of the film may turn some viewers off. I also feel that a particular sexual scene - 
             although evocative and apropos of the tone of the sequence - was not worth the R rating the movie got, and
             may also turn certain segments of the audience off.`,
    trivia:
      "J. Robert Oppenheimer was mentioned by name in Nolan's previous film Tenet (2020) during a conversation between Priya Singh (Dimple Kapadia) and The Protagonist (John David Washington), seemingly indicating that Nolan already had the idea of what his next film was going to be about.",

    quote:
      "You're asking me how a watch works. For now, let's just keep an eye on the time.",
    thoughts: `I watched Sicario expecting a slightly better-than-average action flick centered around 
               cartel violence in Mexico - a topic touched on many times. However, I was taken completely by Villeneuve's masterful
               expression of tension, terror and trauma, simply through BGM, POV, and dialogue (or lack thereof). 
               It could be his taking us through the unethicality of the mission at hand through 
               the POV of Kate (Blunt) - who's just a little too naive for her seasoned Black Ops colleagues, and for the 
               violence & depravity in Juarez. Or it could be through cutting most of Benicio Del Toro's dialogue - 
               for his role as "Alejandro", an insidious "consultant" to the Black Ops team - to bolster his mysterious 
               nature and elevate the sense of Unknown that shrouds the mission we're witnessing. From the very first scene of the movie where 
               hundreds of decomposing bodies are found embedded in the walls of a house, to the border crossing scene, 
               to the end where Kate's life hangs in the balance, it is all a fine work in tension & peril. Roger Deakins' 
               cinematography is no-less, for the aerial wide-shots grasping the size of the environments that the teams are working in, truly 
               convey the monumentality of the task ahead of them. Villeneuve and Deakins surely utilized scale to their 
               advantage in painting pictures of places that may as well eat our protagonists alive. Furthermore the final shot of 
               the movie works brilliantly, in conjunction with the dual meanings of "Sicario", to blur the lines between 
               protagonist and antagonist in this movie. Villeneuve tells us at the start that "Sicario" in Ancient Rome referred to a person 
               who rose up against invaders, and it also means "hitman" in Mexico today. This hints as to the narrative
               of the movie without boxing any of its stakeholders into "the invaded", "the invador" or "the hitman" 
               (for all the groups we're shown could've fit these roles equally). The fact that these definitions are 
               presented at the start is actually in my opinion a cheeky foreshadowing to the uncertainty that the movie imbues in
               the audience (or Kate, as the audience stand-in) as to who exactly to root for as events unfold. In closing, just like Kate I was hooked 
               and accelerated into an experience that I found quintessentially tense, and which I was left in awe after
               dismounting.
