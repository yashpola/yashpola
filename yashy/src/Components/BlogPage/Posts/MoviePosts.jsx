    title:
      "Inglourious Basterds (2009) | Quentin Tarantino | Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender",
    quote: "I think this might just be my masterpiece",
    thoughts: `What worked extremely well for this movie is that it fully embraces itself as an anti-Nazi revisionist
            revenge fantasy. Specifically through the cathartic comeuppance of
            Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) of the SchutzStaffel; a "Jew Hunter" who takes pleasure in exerting power
            over those who have none. Importantly, Tarantino does not force catharsis by exploiting Holocaust tragedy.
            Instead, he builds tension through setting up the meticuluous, cunning, cruel, seemingly immovable Landa against
            the violent, Nazi-despising, unstoppable force of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). The movie thus centers itself
            around the inevitable clash between Landa and Raine, and this I feel is what elevates it beyond generic 
            anti-Nazi revenge porn to a gripping tale of an oppressor who represents Nazi sadism, that gets a gruesome, 
            gratitutous comeuppance at the end. Another aspect of this movie that truly elevates it, is 
            attention to detail. How many movies do we watch that invent miracles
            out of faulty logic to protect their protagonists? In this one though, Michael Fassbender's Lt. Wicox and a couple of
            the other Basterds die because Wicox blew his cover from not knowing the German way to sign 3 (use thumbs!). 
            Lt. Raine and Pt. Utevich (BJ Novak) get captured because Col. Landa called their 
            absurd bluff of being Italian in origin. Even something as basic as a movie being based in Nazi Germany having
            70% of its dialog in German and French signals so much more depth of characterization in a war movie. 
            Sure, war movies can be great even through just giving voices to our American freedom-fighters, and dehumanizing
            the enemy. But the catharsis of anti-Nazi revenge is that much sweeter when the Nazis have meaningful speaking
            roles and characters, and we then see every bit of light in their life evaporate. For a closing thought, in the lasting words of Lt. Aldo
            Raine: 'Bonjyuur-no'`,
    rating: `8/10. The only significant ding I would give this
    movie is that I found Pt. Zoller's (Daniel Bruhl) character somewhat of a misplaced distraction to the focal point 
    of Landa and Raine's arcs. But I understand that his role was functional to highlight an underrepresented aspect of
    the Nazi regime: their utilization of mass-media, specifically cinema, to rally war efforts and
    fluff up their supposed heroism`,
    trivia: `Tarantino almost did not go through with this movie due to not finding a German-speaking actor who 
    could also pull off the role of Hans Landa. Fortunately he found one in the form of Christoph Waltz (who could 
    also speak French fluently), who then won an Oscar for the role.`,

  TrainingDay: {
    name: "Training Day",
    title:
      "Training Day (2001) | Antoine Fuqua | Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke",
    quote: "King Kong ain't got shit on me!",
    thoughts: `I did not know going into this movie that it was about police corruption. However, this worked brilliantly because 
               as the events unfolded, I truly shared Officer Jake Hoyt's (Ethan Hawke) rising sense of suspicion and horror towards
               his bent training officer Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Apropos of that, Washington delivered an 
               effortlessly slick performance as usual, easing gracefully into the role of a corrupt detective who 
               commands attention, but is really a yard bully who deserves only to have his gross facade blown wide open. 
               The rookie-veteran chemistry between Hawke and Washington was of the essence to the success of the 
               movie, with both actors playing their characters off each other in a truly enjoyable fashion. Vis-a-vis 
               the subject matter of the movie, perhaps my favorite scene is the final one, when Det. Harris 
               fruitlessly tries to rally the support of a community that he had been a part of for decades against 
               Jake Hoyt. Det. Harris had given up on society and believed he deserved to look out for himself 
               first (to hell with Serve & Protect right?), but in the end his self-serving tendencies became not only
               his downfall, but his demise. In fact, my interpretation is that Harris had thought he was serving the 
               community in some twisted fashion, by being "one of them" and
               fuelling their gangsterism. This makes the ending more poignant, when the community actually sides with Jake, 
               again because Harris is wrong in believing that deep down the whole world is as ugly as he is. While the plot 
               - supposedly partially based on a true story - and themes themselves are simple, it is rewarding to see
              the innocent virtuosity of Jake Hoyt persist in the face of torture (yes, literally) and betrayal. Interestingly, a
              contrivance often criticized of Training Day is that a girl who Jake saved from being raped in the beginning was conveniently the 
              cousin of a gangster who is enlisted by Harris to kill Jake, thus saving him in the last minute. I don't 
              agree that this is a contrivance. In fact, I see it as a subtle butterfly effect,  
              important to the overall theme - because it is another way of rewarding Jake for actually acting like a cop and 
              saving the girl, against Alonzo's persuasion to ignore street-crimes like theft, rape, and the like.`,
    rating: `I give this movie 7.5/10 because it is a simple story that is carried by very compellingly acted characters. I
    doubt I would have as much fun watching it if not for Denzel and Hawke`,

    title:
      "No Country for Old Men (2007) | Coen Brothers | Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones",
    quote: "What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?",
    thoughts: `This movie to me is one of the greats when it comes to portraying desolation and possibly nihilism. 
               Anton Chigurh (Bardem) does so well as a psychopathic serial killer because he believes he's a vassal for an indifferent 
               universe, bringing death to those he thinks are momentary specks in the scheme of fate. All his scenes work to 
               deliver this message in fact; from when he determined whether a gas station attendant lived or died by a coin flip, to 
               taunting Carla Jean for telling him he doesn't "have to" kill her. What's more interesting is that at the end, Anton 
               himself almost dies in a car crash and has to bribe 2 teenage boys for their silence as he runs off on foot. Whether Anton 
               knows he himself is subject to fate, or he wrongly assumed he was a proteced agent of fate is unknown, but it was a 
               brilliant choice by the Coens to send off his character on this note. While we're here, an interesting ambiguity for me 
               was in the scene where Anton kills someone and when the victim's assistant ponders on whether he would die too. 
               Anton says, "I don't know. Do you see me?". This could either be taken as saying he would spare the assistant if he doesn't 
               tell anyone anything, or that Anton sees himself as some sort of Grim Reaper and that the assistant seeing him means his death 
               is confirmed.
               More on the uninhibited twisted hand of fate
               though, we have the characters of Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) and Sheriff Bell (Jones). The Coens making us follow Moss
               for over half the movie as he desperately flees from Chigurh and then abruply killing him off screen at the hand of some subplot-related
               Mexican gangsters was a very pronounced choice in feeding into the theme of the movie: that most things in real life aren't 
               wrapped up with a bow. Similarly, Sheriff Bell retiring in the middle of the case because he's afraid that the winds, specifically 
               Chigurh, are too strong for him to tussle with is perhaps closest to the title of the movie itself. I interpret the title as
               meaning no one grows old in such desolate lands as those populated by monsters like Chigurh. Certainly when Bell reminisces 
               on being 20 years older now than his father, also a sheriff, when he died, I feel emboldened in my interpretation. A few have 
               criticized NCFOM as pointless and self-indulgent, but I think it is a movie driven very strongly by its choices in writing and direction
               to deliver a certain message and does so successfully.

    trivia: `According to a January 2018 article in Business Insider, a group of psychiatrists studied 400 movies and identified 
    126 psychopathic characters. They chose Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton Chigurh as the most clinically accurate portrayal of a 
    psychopath.`,
