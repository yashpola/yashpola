    thoughts: `What I love about Suits is that it does swimmingly well at hooking you onto it. While definitely not close to 
               legally accurate, its an extremely stylish show with witty characters, compelling music choices, and 
               palpable drama. Suits is often criticized for dropping off 
               in Seasons 6-9, and it is commonly felt that the show peaked in the first 2 seasons. It is true 
               that the show veered away from being an episodic case-of-the-week legal drama into more melodramatic, tired, 
               season-long story arcs that often compromised depth of character. However, I feel that this is as valid as choice as remaining as a raw legal drama. 
               It is certainly not easy to make a show that is as entertaining as Suits is, and also stay true to the
               endless drudgery and waiting-game that real life law is. An inescapable gripe I had with the show though is that 
               the way several characters act would very quickly make them social pariahs in real life. Something I 
               deeply enjoyed while watching Mad Men which I wished Suits had was the very concrete portrayal of characters, in 
               ways that open up meaningful discussion about how the characters drove the plot and vice versa. However, 
               I do credit that the emotional development of the initially narcisstic and stoic Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), 
               is one of the best I've seen in a show. While it could be argued that Specter still remained seemingly all-powerful and needlessly
               aggressive to the end, the portrayal of his emotional struggles with his deeply-embedded issues with his 
               mom was biting. All in all, while Suits may not hold up well in comparison to giants like Breaking Bad & Mad Men, 
               oddly enough it stays relatively clear from becoming a chore to watch especially having spanned nearly 10 seasons. 
               One doesn't regret watching Suits in my opinion.`,
    rating: "7/10",

            appear in the show in significant roles`,
